# Elastos Technical Introduction

If you're a seasoned DApp Developer or blockchain expert the quick explanation of Elastos, for at least the major blockchain components that matter to a typical DApp Developer,
is that it's a hybrid cross between [Namecoin](https://namecoin.org) (PoW) and an Ethereum layer 2 solution such as the [Loom Network](https://loomx.io) (DPoS).

### The Mainchain

The Elastos mainchain merge mines with Bitcoin with PoW following the same [specification](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification) used by Namecoin.

To date (May 2019) Elastos has over 30% of Bitcoin's hashpower and you can see all the pools which merge mine ELA in real-time at [https://blockchain.elastos.org](https://blockchain.elastos.org).

In a way the PoW component of our hybrid consensus model is similar to [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org) which uses *Proof of Burn* which is a more decoupled version of Elastos or Namecoin's PoW merge mining.


### The DPoS Supernodes

The Elastos PoW mainchain uses ELA as its token, this token is also used to vote for DPoS supernodes. Although it uses a simplistic, but pure linear voting scheme where 1 vote
always translates to 36 votes, we feel that until there is a clear winner in the myriad of different solutions this is the fairest system.

We've looked at other more advanced voting solutions like [Decred](https://decred.org) and will continually improve it as we learn from other projects, but implementation of this straightforward solution
has allowed us to quickly build a robust DPoS platform ahead of other earlier projects such as NEO, which has only begun to build on-chain governance in NEO 3.0. 


### The Sidechains

There are 4 sidechains currently on Elastos:

1. **The Ethereum sidechain - DPoS**
    
    This is the recommended sidechain for `Smart Contracts`, it uses the Elastos DPoS Supernodes to verify and sign blocks replacing the more expensive PoW Sybil resistance scheme
    employed by the current public Ethereum chain. The added benefit of using DPoS instead of PoW is that the Elastos Ethereum sidechain runs considerably faster with
    500-1500+ TPS, no changes required to the Solidity smart contracts and still gets its security passed down by our mainchain.
    
    *Please be aware that there is no connection between the Elastos ETH Sidechain and the public Ethereum blockchain*


2. **The DID sidechain - PoW**

    The **Decentralized ID** sidechain provides a basic and low cost key-value store for user profile data, encryption of sensitive data is left to the developer.
    
    
3. **The Token sidechain - PoW**

    This is an ERC20/ERC721 compatible sidechain that allows projects to launch their own token on the Elastos blockchain platform.
    
4. **The NEO sidechain - PoW**
    
    This is a sidechain that supports NEO 2.0 `Smart Contracts` however uses PoW currently until we upgrade it to DPoS.
    
    *Please be aware that there is no connection between the Elastos NEO Sidechain and the public NEO blockchain*
