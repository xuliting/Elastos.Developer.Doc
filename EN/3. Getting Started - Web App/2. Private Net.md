# Setting Up Your Private Net

This step is optional, due to the size and complexity of Elastos, running a private net may be too intensive for some systems.

However as a developer we understand the convenience of being able to run everything locally and develop unimpeded anywhere. 
If you'd like to setup a private net follow the instructions at this Github repo: [https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-privnet](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-privnet)

If you'd like to connect to the TestNet only, click here to go to the next step [3. Hello World](./3. Hello World) 


## Using Your PrivNet

Once you have your private net up and running you should use the following API endpoint reference to connect to your
local Elastos instances instead of the TestNet.
