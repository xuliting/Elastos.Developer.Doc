# Getting Started

The first thing that needs to be clear is that because Elastos is a platform of multiple services there is no single correct way to develop your DApp.

When we talk about decentralized apps (DApps) there are varying levels of decentralization, even the famous Cryptokitties on Ethereum was not fully decentralized.
Of course it is possible to build fully decentralized apps but typically this is onerous and not suggested at the beginning, for our first tutorial we will
build an DApp using our API layer. If you're well versed in blockchain the very usage of an API layer would suggest centralization, however we'll provide details
on how to decentralize that in our [Advanced Guides](../5. Advanced Guides/home.md).
