# Setting Up Your Private Net

This step is optional, due to the size and complexity of Elastos, running a private net may be too intensive for some systems.

However as a developer we understand the convenience of being able to run everything locally and develop unimpeded anywhere. 
If you'd like to setup a private net follow the instructions at this Github repo: [https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-privnet](https://github.com/cyber-republic/elastos-privnet)
