# Elastos Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Elastos Developer website, here you'll find documentation, tutorials and resources to help you get started
learning and building on the Elastos Ecosystem. 

### This Documentation Site is still Under Development - Elastos will be fully launched by August 2019

## Start Building on Elastos with our Tutorial

The Elastos platform is a massive platform and project, but the best way to explain it is by comparing it with cloud service platforms 
that you should already be familiar with.  If you're not familiar with them, here's a recent article you can read [here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-from-public-and-private-cloud-to-software-as-a/).

But generally we assume you've had some web development experience and may even be a seasoned DApp developer, the 
programming language for this tutorial will be Javascript. But there are many ways to develop in another language, please see our [Advanced Guides](../5. Advanced Guides/3. Other Languages)

The key things to keep in mind as you dive into Elastos are:

1. Elastos is a public blockchain and has been running since Dec 2017 with proven reliability
2. The blockchain already has multiple built in layer 2 chains we call `sidechains`, these have unique consensus models and support different functionality
3. The primary blockchain for **Smart Contracts** is the Elastos Ethereum sidechain, this is completely separate from the public Ethereum blockchain
4. Elastos provides a variety of common services, these are decentralized versions and each have their own unique quirks 


Typically when you develop on a cloud platform you deploy and connect to a variety of services based on your needs,
