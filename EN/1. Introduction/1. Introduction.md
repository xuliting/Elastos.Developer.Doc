# Elastos Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Elastos Developer website, here you'll find documentation, tutorials and resources to help you get started
learning and building on the Elastos Ecosystem. 

### Elastos is Open-Source - See our Github at https://github.com/elastos

*Please note some repositories remain private while development is in development and has not passed security audits*


#### This Documentation Site is still Under Development

## Start Building on Elastos with our Tutorial

The Elastos platform is a massive platform and project, but the best way to explain it is by comparing it with cloud service platforms 
that you should already be familiar with.  If you're not familiar with them, here's a recent article you can read [here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-from-public-and-private-cloud-to-software-as-a/).

But generally we assume you've had some web development experience and may even be a seasoned DApp developer, the 
programming language for this tutorial will be Javascript. But there are many ways to develop in another language, please see our [Advanced Guides](../5. Advanced Guides/3. Other Languages)

The key things to keep in mind as you dive into Elastos are:

1. Elastos is a public blockchain and has been running since Dec 2017 with proven reliability
2. The blockchain already has multiple built in layer 2 chains we call `sidechains`, these have unique consensus models and support different functionality
3. The primary blockchain for **Smart Contracts** is the Elastos Ethereum sidechain, this is completely separate from the public Ethereum blockchain
4. Elastos provides a variety of common services, these are decentralized versions and each have their own unique quirks. You can learn more about these
later in the **API Documentation** section. 

### To keep things simple we will be developing a web application

Typically when you develop a web app on a cloud platform you deploy and connect to a variety of services based on your needs, the most common services you need are:

- **Client side web application** - for now we'll keep this the same as you're familiar with
- **Back-end API of some sort** - this isn't really decentralized but you can replace this with the Elastos Carrier P2P network or redesign your client side application run a light node
- **Database** - in the DApp world typically you store data on the blockchain, there are some decentralized databases but none have gained widespread adoption. 
Blockchains are inherently slower and more costly than traditional centralized databases, so a typical learning curve involves how to design your DApps to minimize usage of the blockchain
- **Storage** - somewhere to store your static files like images, documents and other files

Hopefully none of this seems too daunting, we'll slowly walk you through how to take a familiar web app and make it run on Elastos in a more decentralized manner.
