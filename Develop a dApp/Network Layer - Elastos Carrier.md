# Network Layer - Elastos Carrier

Elastos Carrier solves the problem that the app nodes on the Internet have no public network ip and cannot be directly connected. Usually solving this problem requires deploying a central server for data transfer.
Also, Elastos Carrier implements a centerless direct connection communication scheme based on P2P communication technology.

Elastos Carrier provides cross-network access capabilities. For example, any two app nodes can be in different subnets, one is at home wifi environment, another is at corporate wifi environment. App can communicate directly by using an "address" string and confirming the authorization by adding "friends" to each other.
