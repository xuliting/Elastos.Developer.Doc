# Overview

DID (Decentralized Identifier) ​​refers to a digital identity that can be issued by the user and independently proves ownership.

In the technical implementation of the traditional Internet, it is usually necessary to issue a digital identity by the center. This will avoid naming conflicts, complete authentication, and then complete identity verification between strangers through this center.

Inspired by Bitcoin's decentralized wallet, we can use the wallet address as the user's ID and perform the verification by the public key corresponding to the address. Third parties are no longer required to identify themselves between strangers. Thus providing a digital identity solution for the independent and autonomous operation of the Internet.

Based on the above, Elastos implemented Elastos DID Side-Chain, which provides a decentralized digital identity solution for the Internet world, allowing everyone to have their own DID for free. By having a DID, everyone can self-sovereign in the Internet world; everyone can assert their own digital assets; everyone can communicate securely based on trusted identity.

Elastos DID is generated, verified and certified based on Elastos DID Side-Chain.
