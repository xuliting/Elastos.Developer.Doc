# ES/IPs
Elastos Smartweb Improvement Proposals (ESIPs) describe standards for the Smartweb platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.


## ESIP status terms
- Draft - an ESIP that is open for consideration and is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
- Last Call - an ESIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.
- Accepted - a core ESIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author. The process for Core Devs to decide whether to encode an ESIP into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the ESIP process. If such a decision is made, the ESIP wil move to final.
- Final (non-Core) - an ESIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.
- Final (Core) - an ESIP that the Core Devs have decided to implement and release in a future hard fork or has already been released in a hard fork.
- Deferred an ESIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.
