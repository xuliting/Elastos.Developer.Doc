# SIPs
Smartweb Improvement Proposals (SIPs) describe standards for the Smartweb platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.


## SIP status terms
- Draft - an SIP that is open for consideration and is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
- Last Call - an SIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.
- Accepted - a core SIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author. The process for Core Devs to decide whether to encode an SIP into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the SIP process. If such a decision is made, the SIP wil move to final.
- Final (non-Core) - an SIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.
- Final (Core) - an SIP that the Core Devs have decided to implement and release in a future hard fork or has already been released in a hard fork.
- Deferred an SIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.
